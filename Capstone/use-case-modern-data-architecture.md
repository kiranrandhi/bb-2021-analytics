# Modern Data Architecture (formerly Lake House)

Organizations have been building data lakes to analyze massive amounts of data for deeper insights into their data.
To do this, they bring data from multiple silos into their data lake, and then run analytics and AI/ML directly on it. It is
common for these organizations to also have data stored in specialized data stores, such as a NoSQL database, a
search service, or a data warehouse, to support different use cases. To efficiently analyze all of the data spread
across the data lake and other data stores, businesses often move data in and out of data lake and between these
data stores. This data movement can get complex and messy as the data grows in these stores. To address this,
businesses need a data architecture that not only enables building scalable, cost-effective data lakes but also
supports simplified governance and data movement between various data stores. We refer to this as a lake house
architecture. Simply put, a lake house is a modern data architecture that integrates a data lake, a data warehouse,
and other purpose-built data stores while enabling unified governance and seamless data movement.
