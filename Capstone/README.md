# Capstone Project Rubric:

The Capstone Project is a way to showcase all the learnings from the track. 
You are expected to pick one of the use cases below.
For an actual implementation, research something that might be usable in your current organization or customer.
Think how it might be used to enhance or develop Analytics within your organization.

# Use Cases

# Evaluation

Your Capstone project will be evaluated by a Specialist SA Panel and the Blackbelt Program team using the criteria in this rubric.
The rubric is NOT an exhaustive list of Do's and Dont's.
It is meant to serve as Pillars (Data Collection, Data Storage & Management etc).
Each Pillar corresponds to the Domain in the Analytics Specialty certification exam.

Each Pillar is either evaluated as Below The Bar, Meets the Bar or Raise the Bar.
Points are awarded based on how each pillar was addressed in your Capstone Project.
There are guidelines available for each Pillar. These are NOT an exhaustive list of everything you should be or should not be doing. They are merely examples to help guide you in the right direction.
For e.g. 
Manually ingesting data in S3 is considered Below the Bar for "Data Collection" in your Project.
No Enterprise Analytics project will do that.
However, like any enterprise, you might have one process and a valid reason to upload a specific file manually, that will not cause your pillar to be graded "Below the Bar".
Use your best judgement and logic to make sure you are aiming for "Raising The Bar" for every pillar.
As always, any questions? Reach out to the Black belt team.
