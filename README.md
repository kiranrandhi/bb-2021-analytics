# Black Belt 2.0 Data and Analytics 2021

A 3-Week training program to enable blackbelts to earn the Data Analytics Cert and get ready for the Capstone project as one of the outcomes of the BB Pilot Program. Also, our goal is to discuss real world implementation strategies and best practices with attendees during sessions.

Essentially the goal is to develop highly skilled builders within the partner community

What makes this different than other program or training initiative is the focus on proven hands on experience with in the domain specialty coupled with the technical community between AWS and the Partner Black Belts, plus the value the new specialized practitioners bring to partners in terms of hosting Immersion Days or other events, creating blogs, and building new or upskilling existing practice areas for Partners.

A typical track module workshop consists of 20 to 40 hours of Ninja talks with AWS field experts, labs to build hands-on working expertise, and homework to reinforce learning all led by AWS experts.

After completing the module new Black Belt practitioners will be expected to demonstrate their knowledge through project based initiatives that might include a series of TFC like accomplishments or a one-time capstone project much like completing a doctoral project.

Once a Partner and Member become part of the Black Belt community each are expected to contribute to the community by:
- Building specialty packages within the specific track attended i.e. Data and Analytics.
- Hosting  Immersion Days or other customer engagement events at least quarterly, 
- Kick-start building a practice area or raising the bar in an existing practice area.
- Fostering innovation or helping build the Black Belt community within their Organization by sending x-practitioners through the APN BB Pilot, 
- Writing blogs in there new specialization. 

In turn, Partner can expect:
- To be recognized using the Black Belt title and future badging
- Have networking and social opportunities to build relationships across AWS specialist
- Have access to specialized Ninja talks
- Have early consideration for AWS Partner Opportunities
